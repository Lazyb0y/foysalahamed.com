I've done all I could to save,<br>
This endearment that's here.<br>
A simple call blurs everything..<br>
Descending what's at stake,<br>
A risk I had to take.<br>
The worst is here,<br>
What's left to keep sake?

So call on me..<br>
I'll see the day,<br>
Your faded love for me vanishes.<br>
Lets be real here,<br>
Distance is what caused this to end.<br>
Just use that fight in you,<br>
And it will be perfect again real soon.<br>

Lately,<br>
I've been lost without your light on me.<br>
Just find this here..<br>
And I leave it all for you to find here.<br>
Lately,<br>
I've been damaged goods..<br>
So what's a day?<br>
A finders fee to the forever we spoke of gently.<br>

I know where I'm going..<br>
And you know that too.<br>
But somehow it got twisted in the likes of you<br>
Lets be real here,<br>
I think that you scared.<br>
To find someone that understands you,<br>
But lives a million miles away.<br>

So without a fight,<br>
Or without a lie..<br>
Your gone and now I hope you put the pieces back just fine.<br>
